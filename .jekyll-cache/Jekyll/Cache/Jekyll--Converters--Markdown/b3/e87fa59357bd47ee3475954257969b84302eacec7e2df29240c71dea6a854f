<p>Why would I include this quote at the start of my blog? Now that I’m 5 months into my journey, I thought it’d be nice to look back on what I’ve learned so far. Also, don’t worry, I promise that quote isn’t just thrown in there as some random inspirational bs.</p>

<p>The biggest lesson I’ve learned in these last 5 months, is that <strong>nothing</strong> worth having is ever fast or easy to attain. As a society, we’ve fallen in love with this idea of reaching the top at breakneck speeds and seeing success as something reserved for those who are willing to sacrifice everything and grind their days away. We point to examples like a startup that managed (insert startup that did well) while turning a blind eye to startups like Theranos whose downfall was because they scammed their investors to try and live up to that fast success idealization we’ve all come to expect. Just like everyone else around me, I bought into this idea and had a subsequent crash and burn when I failed to attain the quick rating goals I had set out for myself.</p>

<p>(how this ties into being consistent) We always here that you should only try and beat the you from yesterday, but it’s a lot easier said than done. For me personally, this was one of the biggest struggles I suffered from. All the friends I had made had been doing CP for a lot longer so of course I couldn’t emulate their performance. Mentor had made USACO Plat in one season, i didnt.</p>
