<p>Weâ€™re back in business. After disappointing performances over winter break and then
not promoting to USACO Gold in January, I decided to take a break from blogging and
grinding too hard.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What Is It?</h2>
<p>Entitlement Poison is what I call it when you practice and feel entitled to progress.
I know this sounds crazy but here me out. All our lives weâ€™re told that if you work hard: youâ€™ll improve, but
that logic doesnâ€™t apply smoothly to competitive programming. Not only is your rating relative to how
other people perform,
What Iâ€™ve come to realize is practice doesnâ€™t correlate with performance.</p>
