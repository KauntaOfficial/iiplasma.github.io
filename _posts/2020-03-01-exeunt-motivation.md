## Here We Go Again
It's over. The honeymoon phase that is, not that actual road to 2000. Although I've been
radio silent for almost two months, the challenge isn't over yet. In this post we'll be talking about why I've been gone for so long and how you could avoid a similar fate.

## School
For everyone that didn't know, I'm in dual enrollment. This means I take half high school courses and half college level courses. This also entails having my entire schedule and routines flipped on their head after winter break which was a new experience for me. Adjusting to a lot more coursework and new classes left me drowning in a sea of coursework grasping for any practice time I could get.

The combination of having a totally new schedule and my routines
falling apart over winter break left me starving for time. I've just been trying to pull
myself together the past few weeks and it's finally starting to show. 

## Entitlement
I'm sure a lot of you read the heading and had no idea how this could possibly relate to CP
~~well neither can I~~. Over winter break and January, I fell prey to feeling entitled to results.
I spent most of my time on CP during November and December so by the time the late December contests rolled around, I was prepared to see big increases in rating. Just a quick glance at my rating graph reveals that didn't really happen. With these mediocre performances in the back of my mind, I took the USACO January contest. Although I didn't realize it at the time, I had mentally decided that this my final chance to prove all that practice was worth it. This was honestly more soul-crushing than the December CF contests, as the mistake that cost me the promotion to gold was trying to use binary search on a brute force problem. The perfect storm of a result oriented mindset with a chain of narrow failures decimated my will to continue practicing and my sense of purpose.  

## Pokemon
Do I need to explain myself here? It’s a good game.

## Outro
So what does the future for the blog and me look like? I’m going to be practicing really hard over the next month to attempt to get USACO Gold/Plat in the Open, so expect the blog to mostly pivot to USACO content for a little while. I’m also going to try and fit more CF and AtCoder contests in my schedule going forward so look forward to recaps and maybe mini editorials in the near future. I’m off to start practicing USACO, so until next week, Ivy signing off. P.S. I know at least one person actually enjoys these blogs, so apologies for not updating in such a long time.
