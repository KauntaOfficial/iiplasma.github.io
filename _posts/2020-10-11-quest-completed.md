> Are you f&!*)#$ kidding me. - Me with a predicted rating of 1999 before system tests

Before we get to the meat of the blog, I have some people to thank because I definitely didn't accomplish this alone. Thanks to Errichto, Benq, and Geothermal for humoring me from the start and answering my questions. Thanks to Enchom for the first good luck message that has stuck with me from the very beginning (also the super cute profile picture). Thanks to my super secret, not really mentor, pretty much a mentor, and good friend: galen_colin for teaching me most of the "dumb tricks" I know and listening in calls while I have a meltdown over not solving Div 2 Bs as a CM[^1]. And thanks to everyone who reads this and supports my second-rate writing for reasons that still elude me.

I've thought about what to do if I actually hit 2000 in a year, and I had all these stupid plans and grandiose ideas, but I think I've finally come up with something satisfactory. For the long time readers, you'll remember that the very first post contained 3 questions I asked some GM-LGM people, so for the 2000 milestone, I'll be taking the 5-10 top questions in the comments [on the CodeForces post here](sdfsdf){: target="_blank" }, competitive programming related or not, and answering them in the next post.

Oh and don't worry about this blog going anywhere anytime soon, I've got some ideas brewing that I can't wait to share with you guys. But until then, thanks for reading, and I'll catch you on my new series: Year to 3000.[^2]
