## Intro
Hey everyone and welcome back to another blog post! Special shoutout to our
sponsor this week: Finals. Without Finals, I would've made a post last Sunday so
be sure to show them some love for saving you from the pain of reading these
posts. This week, like the title suggests, I'll be talking about MathForces and
how its a keystone of succeeding at CodeForces.

## But Why?
I've seen a lot of distaste towards very math heavy rounds and being the
impressionable person I am, I adopted the same mindset. So when I checked my
spreadsheet and saw math as my weakest tag, my trepidation levels were off the
chart. And after struggling to solve even 1400s, it seemed my assumptions were
correct that math is stupid.
