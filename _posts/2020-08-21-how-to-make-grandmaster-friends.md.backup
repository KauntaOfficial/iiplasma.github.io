Want to get help on problems but don't have any high rated friends? Does paying
for a competitive programming mentor seem completely ridiculous? Well today is
your lucky day, as I'll be teaching you 3 simple techniques to make Grandmaster
friends[^1]!

## Integrity

To ensure the effectiveness of these techniques, I've taken the following
measures to ensure the conditions are as close as possible to what you might
experience in your own field tests:

1. To simulate the success of someone in a lower rating range, I've created an
   unrated alt account[^2] that has no ties with my original account. 

2. For a random sample of GMs, I've randomly generated 3 names from the pool of
   active competitors on Codeforces.

## Technique #1 - Death by Words (DW)

While GMs might intimidate you with their large rating, you can parry with an
equally large vocabulary. Taking inspiration from peacocks, we'll artificially
boost our "plumage" of knowledge to try and get the GM to respond. When writing
any message to a GM, just throw it in this [text
converter](https://honk.moe/tools/verysmart.html){:target="_blank"} to instantly
boost your chances at getting a response. Just like competitive programming,
it's important to get the fundamentals down first, so be sure to master this
before moving onto higher level techniques.

### Analysis

I've gone with a stock standard greeting followed by the classic, "long time no
see, bro". This is essential to build rapport between us before he realizes
what's being done. Although not shown in the screenshot, I've also submitted
multiple compilation errors, not because I can't program, but to garner
sympathy. I've included another bonus tip in the submission on how to optimize
your code for better results for the truly dedicated.

Mr. Colin must think he's quite clever now that he's outwitted us by asking
where the submission is, but we aren't out of tricks yet. These nonanswer
responses are quite common, but it's always key to keep pushing until you
recieve a firm no.

## Technique #2 - Write a Blog (WB)

Although this technique is lengthy and requires far greater amounts of work than
the most methods, it's also the most risk averse. You start a blog series on, I
don't know, maybe some "Road to Reach xxxx" to lure GMs in like moths to a
flame.  Once they leave a comment, you can quickly slide in their DMs with a
"would you be willing to help" or something along the lines of what I show
below.

### Analysis

I don't have any blog posts on this account, but luckily Summitwei wasn't too
observant. We're mixing it up from Technique 1 by starting off with Sir instead
of Mr for a nice bit of alliteration, but this isn't required for success. For
this example, I'm employed the famous Karangreat Gambit: asking directly for
help during live contests. Most people follow the Modernist school of philosophy
that the gambit is unsound for modern day play, but I use it here to highlight
some lesser known techniques and to spice up the usual boring exchanges that
come from the WB opening. But with any chess, I mean friend making, opening,
it's important to look at the opponent's response.

Another nonanswer. Although these might seem like failures, getting any response
is better than none at all. The key thing to note is that Summit never
explicitly says no, which is a **clear** signal that he would like to discuss
the specifics such as monetary payment on another platform where direct messages
are truly private. Usual recommendations include Telegram, Facebook Messenger,
and Clash of Clans global chat.

## Technique #3 - Beg[^3]

If things are truly going south, not that they are right now, it might be time
to resort to "Code GM Red" measures. Beg, plead, and offer to pay them for help.
You aren't desperate, you're simply building confidence for your next session.
At least that's what I tell myself.

### Meta Analysis

Grammar and Spelling? Out the window. Decency? Who needs that. Forget what I
wrote about the first two techniques, just use this one. Turn off your brain,
forget what manners are, and prepare for the greatness that awaits you.

## Recap

Everyone knows that "third time is the charm", so we actually have an 100%
success rate. Need I say more?

[^2]: Making alt accounts is against CodeForces rules, but seeing as it was in the name of education, I sincerely hope Mike shall allow an exception without banishing me from the face of the Earth. Then again, there are accounts like [kaunta_oRZ](https://codeforces.com/profile/kaunta_orz){: target="_blank" } which simultaneously break the alt account rule and the "Do not use harsh, rude or **misleading** handle." guideline, so there remains hope yet.
[^3]: This seems like a good time to acknowledge that you won't be making "friends" in the classic sense of the word whether or not you succeed. But let's be honest with each other, you just wanted someone to explain editorials for when you're feeling lazy.
