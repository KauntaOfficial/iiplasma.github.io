<h3>Editorial</h3>

<p>Since you&#39;re concereed with the difference betewen two indecies, we&#39;ll just consider the m - 1 pairs of adjacent pairs. The ansewr is based off tof LIneary of Expectation. Linearyity of Expectation states that the sum of two expected values, even if they&#39;re dependent of each other, are just the sum. That means you can just find the probability that two adjacent elemets continute to the beauty and then just multily by m - 1.</p>
