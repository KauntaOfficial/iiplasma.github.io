Where Did I Go Wrong? (WDIGW)

That's right, new series time baby. *Where Did I Go Wrong? (WDIGW)* is a series where I attempt reader submitted problems, describe my thought process, analyze your thinking, and come out on the other side showing where **you** went wrong (and how to improve, but that isn't as catchy).

The rating range is purposely set to be just outside my comfort zone, so I can't promise that I will always solve the problems you submit. I'm bound to make mistakes in my thinking, my code may be messy, and I might get 20 WAs, but hopefully these mistakes will be instructive in terms of what not to do.
