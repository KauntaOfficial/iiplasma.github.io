## Escaping Hope Programming
In chess there's an idea of playing "Hope Chess": making a move and not calculating your opponent's response and the merit of the move. Although you don't have one-on-one competition against a physical opponent in competitive programming, each problem posts (poses) similar questions (challenges) as a biological  for you to answer,. If this I do this, what awill happen? Does this violate some part o fthe constraints/

## Ad-Hoc & Casework
The bane of every competitive programmer. How dare problemsetters turn us into machines that just seek out edge cases instead of giving us problems with elegant solutions?


## You Perform How You Practice (Enahnced Reflection)
It's obvious that your long term performance in contests is a reflection of your practice, but I feel as if most people aren't practicing correctly. 

## Perfectian
I'm not perfect. If you take a look at my solves, in the Global Round 8(09),  I solved C 3 minutes before the end of the contest with half a million WAs, and those were all just hopeful shot in the dark guesses that really had no difference. Even when I'm now rigorously trying to validate my ideas and stop making hopeful shot in the dark guesses (reptitioin), I still fall prey to it when there's external pressure. THe important thing isn't that you failed to do perfactly this time, it's just to do a little liess shitty next time. 

## The Outro
The next time you're bashing up a two paragraph essay on why casework is terrible and removed from the site, maybe insetead consider how your e thinking isn't correct and how to change that inteasd :p
