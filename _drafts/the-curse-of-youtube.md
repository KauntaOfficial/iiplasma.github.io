title: Why Everyone is using YouTube Wrong
---

Whether you create or watch YouTube videos for competitive programming, you're
probably doing it wrong.

## Content

To truly understand the crux of my argument, we first have to take a look at the
word "content". By itself, the word has no connotation and might take the crown
for one of the most ambiguous words in the English language. Content conveys
that there is but cannot explain the composition of what "is" is. Content is a
means to an end whether that is education, entertainment, or a plethora of other
goals, but not an end in itself. And so with that, let's just into my first
gripe.

## Screencasts

What is good about screencasts?
- See how they tackle problems
- Thinking process? Same as point 1

Why are the ineffective?

These ~2 hour long videos usually with a [x place] seem to be the new hot craze
yet provide so little value. You're essentially watching someone quietly work
through a contest without any explanations or anything of substance. Why? These
videos are the CP equivalent of blogging: low quality, high quantity. There are
screencasts where people try to compete while teaching at the same time, but
these two goals are directly at odds with one another. To do well in a contest
requires speed not only in thinking but in execution; whereas, teaching others
demands patience and a thorough explanation of concepts. The results of these
hybrid screencasts is just dissapointment whether you came to watch someone
compete at the highest level or wanted to glean information on how to tackle
problems. The other way of compensating for the lack of information in
screencasts is a review of the problems after the contest, but these are just an
afterthought from a tired competititor rather than the concise, well thought out
prepared editorials you'd usually find after contests. No matter what method
people try and use to counter the implicit dullness of screencasts, they aren't
enough.

## Utilization

While the first half of this blog was with the creation side, the latter half
shall deal with the gross misuse of it. The general template for watching a
video I imagine goes something like this:

- Step 1: Watch video
- Step 2: **Enlightenment**

You can find video editorials littered about in the comment sections of many
editorial 
How can I make that assumption? The hordes of people thanking youtubers and the
the thousands of views

My largest gripe isn't even with Youtube
channels; but rather, with how people who watch videos use them. You sit through
the video and then boom, **enlightenment.** Or something along those lines I
suppose. These videos are great, but passively consuming them without any
practice won't bring about any benefits. Watching videos by themselves won't
provide much improvement, it's the practice you do using the learned concepts
that gains you rating. The most revealing example of this misuse of resources
can be seen with the new high quality format of video lectures alongside custom
problemsets. The friction between watching the video to solving the problems is
as low as possible since most of the problem solutions are either explained in
the video or are closely related to the topic at hand yet even this shows
extremely low conversion rates.  As of the time of writing:

SecondThread's Tree Basics:
- 8,979 views -> 786 solves on problem A
- 8.75% conversion rate

Errichtos Matrix Exponentiation:
- 18,049 views -> 757 solves on problem A
- 4.19% conversion rate

These are custom problems directly made to complement the lectures, so we can
only imagine how low the rates are for lectures where the problems aren't
handpicked. For the amount of time put into these lectures, it's upsetting how
under utilized the most important of these formats is. (bad)

## Gems

This does make the title of a misnomer, but it'd be a false claim that there
isn't any good content on the site. Here are some of what I believe to be the
highest quality channels:

- Errichto
- SecondThread (Best video is his secret competitive programming setup to which
  I attribute all my successes)
- AlgorithmsLive

## Conclusion
I may have missed some value of screencasts or of general content creation in
general so feel free to bash me in the comments, I've been wrong before. Maybe
don't admit that at the end T-T
