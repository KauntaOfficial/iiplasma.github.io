## Intro

**Address how you've heard people say that they can't get back in the flow of practicing after corona threw a wrench into their daily lives.**In this time of chaos and an unprecedented lack of toilet paper, how do you escape the continuous cycle of fear mongering and deal with the unpredictable volatility that every new day brings? What do we do when even the most basic habits we have in place like driving to school or work get changed and we have to adapt. It'd be preposterous for me to claim to have the golden ticket to staying focused and stoic, but for me personally, meditation and a daily log have kept me on the right track. Also, I realize it's extremely ironic that I'm writing about focus after I postponing my last blog post to work on this one instead, but oh well.

## Daily Log

Although my logs and training journal have went from analog to digital, my daily logs haven't. Besides the scientific evidence that shows physical writing improves your memory of the content much better than typing does, there's also an pass√© beauty to the binding nature of scheduling using a pen and paper. Tasks transform from measly colored blocks that can be removed with a few leisurely taps to steadfast promises you made to yourself that require an self admittance of defeat to get crossed out. Seeing crossed out tasks from past days also acts as a reminder to one-up the me from yesterday and stay on task.





Tasks suddenly aren't objects that are able leisurely rescheduled or removed at by the power of two taps, but gigaliths that require an admittance of failure   A daily log for me is just a general schedule with blocks of time set aside to accomplish certain tasks.
