## Updated Practice Guide
The last time I talked about how I practiced, I got (rightfully) destroyed by Um_nik in the comment sections.

Getting trolled by yourself, just wonderful. I was pretty off the mark about I went about it the first time, so hopefully this guide won't have another flaming from another LGM again.

## Don't Solve Multiple Times.
When I first started, I practiced CP the same way I attacked school subjects: spaced repetition, except it just didn't make a lot of sense

## Diversify
This is something I've since discovered, but practicing and doing contests on multiple sites is a great boon to your overall skills. Back when I was solely doing contests and practice on CodeForces, I found myself get really terrible anxiety before every contest I did and caused me to plateau for a long while. Now that I've started spending more time on AtCoder, I find that I generally don't feel that same pressure when doing contests. It might just be a placebo effect, but it's definitely worked wonders for me.
