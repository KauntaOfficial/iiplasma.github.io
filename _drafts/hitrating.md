## How To Get The Rating You Want
That's right, you read the title correctly. I've found a tool that you can use [here](www.google.com) which
will answer almost **ANY** competitive programming you have, it's truly incredible. There are tens, possibly hundreds,
of well-written blogs on the what and how to improve your skills which I'll let you use the wonderful tool above to find,
but today I'm going to attack this problem from a slightly different angle.
Today I'm going to systematically answer the most common questions I see.

Instead of the what or the how, today
I'll be delving into the question of why. (Is it truly the why?)

## Tunnel Vision

At the core of every post along the lines of "I'm stuck." and "Oh mighty grandmasters please show me the way" the lie two 
things, hope and rating.








Taking inspiration from a recent div 2, if rating is a carrot on a stick, we're the pig.
Rating, rating, rating. The elusive 


I was in your shoes only a few months ago, deadset on hitting 2000. 
I know it sounds counterintuitive, but to get the rating you want, you have to forget the rating you want. Instead
of the reward at the end, focus on just practicing x hours each day. Instead of some arbitrary number as your motivation
which is a one time hit of joy, have meeting your goals each day be enough. When the emphasis is on the end result, it's
easy to forget that achievements are the byproduct of hard work, not the other way around.

aLet's forget about the rating you dream about, and think about how much time you're able to put in each week.
Let's forget about whatever rating you desire for a second, and think about how much time you're willing to put 
into competitive programming. Better yet, don't just think about how much you're willing to practice, and just do 
it. 

## "How long does it take to get x rating?"

Entitlement is a topic I've discussed before, but I think these questions of "How long does it take to hit x rating"
truly show how warped our human perception of improvement is. Improvement is a tortuous road with no straight lines.


## "Please (Insert Red Coder), tell me your secrets"
Unlike anything other community I've witnessed, people in competitive programming seem hooked on the idea that
**if** they knew how to practice or some "Grandmaster Secret", they would be able to make progress. The secret has
been out for years, it's hard work. 

Next time you start worrying about the end result of your practices, put your head down and start practicing.
