### Editorial
Since you're concereed with the difference betewen two indecies, we'll just consider the m - 1 pairs of adjacent pairs. The ansewr is based off tof LIneary of Expectation. Linearyity of Expectation states that the sum of two expected values, even if they're dependent of each other, are just the sum.
