## The War

All throughout human history we can witness the clash between breadth and depth.
Mnogamy vs Pologamy, DFS vs BFS. and I'm completely out of metaphors but you get
the point I'm sure. This contrast was made painstakingly clear when I was
thinking about the number of topics I truly understand. I know bitmask dp only
by name, segment trees exist only in the realm of my clipboard, and Tarjan's
algorithm seems just reminds me onf the condom brand. Yet despite my lack of
knowledge, I still manage to pretty consistently solve A-D ond Div 2s.

## Copycart

I'm by no means the first person to highlight the dispartiy . (All)Most of the
advice I've seen from top competitiors always aay something along the lines of
"Practice ->Learn algorithms as needed"., yet so many people always seem to want
to learn the "Standard" algorithms. That's not to say there aren't algorithms
that are prevalent in competitive programming, but the best way to discvoer and
elarn them is to find them organically. I learned about dfs, bfs, dp, heaps, and
other concepts in class theoretically, yet it was only when I was able to
connect it to solving tangible problems was I able to fully grapsp the ooncepts.

It's not sexy. I love learning about cool algiorithms and getting my mind blown
as much as anyone else, but if you care about want to build a strong foundation
and see tangible results in your practice, it's time to strap down and get
really good at the basics.
