Today I'm going to going to make the argument why you should treat competitive programming like poker.

## RNG
As much as we'd like to believe competitive programming is all skill, there is some inherent luck in it too. Sometimes you might do terrible in a contest because you haven't learned what segment tree is yet, so you can solve C, and other times you'll do really well because everybody else is too busy angrily commenting that there's too much story and that they hate My Little Ponies. You could have perfect focus and utmost concentration yet still do terrible, that's just how these things go. The thing is, your contest performance != your actual performance. Let's take a look at Round #666 for example where I placed 655th place. Although I gained rating and had a decently fast D, I ultimately lost my focus at the end and didn't check B for overflow which caused me to fall from ~200 to 655 for a weak performance no matter what the rating is.

No matter if you gain or lose rating, it's important to make sure **you** didn't fail.

## Plateau
Yes I know, we all hate that word. You put in all that practice, yet your rating acts like a stubborn cow that's fine where it is. But if we realize that what we do ultimately isn't the end all be all of our rating, suddenly plateaus make so much more sense.

But this quote assumes you're on the right path, sometimes its more like 

> "You have to take step back, or you will not be able to move ahead."

All this practice
