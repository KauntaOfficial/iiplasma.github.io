Want to get help on problems but don't have any high rated friends? Does paying
for a CP mentor seem completely ridiculous? Today is your lucky day, as I've
got just the solution for you[^1].
 
## Integrity

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques, I've taken the following
measures to ensure the conditions are as close to what you might experience in
your own tests.

1. To simulate the success of someone in a lower rating range, I've created an
   unrated alt account[^2] that has no ties with my original account. 

2. For a random sample of GMs, I've randomly generated 3 names from the pool of
   active competitors on Codeforces, who I have 0 personal ties to. 

(TODO: Maybe include some plot drama to try and add some actual character arc)
(TODO: Decide whether I use we or I) We also use transcriptions of the chats for
readability but include screenshots as proof these are not just fabricated
texts.

## Technique #1 - Death by Words (DW)

While GMs might intimidate you with their large rating, you can parry with an
equally large vocabulary. Taking inspiration from peacocks, we'll artificially
boost our "plumage" of knowledge to try and get the GM to respond. When writing
any message to a GM, just throw it in this [text
converter](https://honk.moe/tools/verysmart.html) to instantly boost your
chances at getting a response. Just like competitive programming, it's important
to get the fundamentals down first, so be sure to master this before moving on.

### Meta Analysis

I've gone with a stock standard greeting followed by the classic, "long time no
see, bro". This is essential to try and establish a line of connection between
us instantly before he realizes what's being done. Although not shown in the
screenshot, I've also submitted multiple compilation errors, not because I can't
program, I swear, but to garner sympathy. I've included another bonus tip in the
submission on how to optimize your code, but  we'll move onto his response.

Mr. Colin here must think he's quite clever now that he's outwitted us by asking
where the submission is, but we aren't out of tricks yet. These nonanswer
responses are quite common as you'll see throughout the post, but it's always
key to keep pushing until you recieve a firm no.

## Technique #2 - Write a Blog (WB)

Although this technique is lengthy and requires far greater amounts of work than
the most methods, it's also the most risk averse. You start a blog series on, I
don't know, maybe some "Road to Reach xxxx" to lure GMs in like flies to honey.
Once they leave a comment, you can quickly slide in their DMs with a "would you
be willing to help" or something along the lines of what I show below.

### Meta Analysis

I don't have any blog posts on this account, but luckily Summitwei wasn't too
observant. We're mixing it up from Technique 1 by starting off with a Sir
instead of a Mr for a nice bit of alliteration, but this isn't required for
success. For this example, I'm employed the famous Karangreat Gambit: asking
directly for help during live contests. Most people follow the Modernist school
of philosophy that the gambit is unsound for modern day play, but I use it here
to highlight some lesser known techniques and to spice up the usual boring
exchanges that come from the WB opening. But with any chess, I mean friend
making, opening, it's important to look at the opponent's response, so let's
move onto that now.

We recieve a nonanswer quite similar to Colin's in content or rather lack
thereof.  The key thing to note is that Summit never explicitly says no, which
is a clear signal that he would like to discuss the specifics such as monetary
payment and payment options on another platform where direct messages are truly
private. Common recommendations for further exchanges are Telegram with Bitcoin
as currency, but you can use whatever you fancy.  Speaking of chatting
platforms, let's move onto our 3rd technique.

## Technique #3 - WhiteMale (WM)

Start accusing them of using illicit drugs such as caffeine or heroin to
blackmail them into complying. Much like this paragraph, it has to be abrupt so
the recipient doesn't have time to rationally address our wild accusations. [^3]
Warning: This is one of the most volatile techniques, so be prepared to handle
both extreme losses and successes. Using Discord as your chat service isn't a
requirement, but public servers provide much lower acquisition cost per GM
compared to less commonly used tools like WhatsApp and Email. (Plus it makes a
great pun if that's what you care about)

### Meta Analysis

Following proper technique as shown earlier, I also include an extra flair in
alluding to a "CodeForces EULA Section 5.4-23". This is utter nonsense but the
extra touch of authority could be the edge needed to coerce the GM to comply
with our extravagant requests. The rest of the message follows the template as
seen in Technique 1 and Technique 2, so I won't elaborate here. (TODO: Link to
those headings) This technique is extremely reliant on having formal language to
set the tone of the writing, the other two are more lax in terms of writing
skill. Also important to use "we" instead of "I" to imply a large group behind
you.

Hey best friend geniosity,
Through some extensive research, I've found that 

He must cave for the character arc

## Recap

We get 2 non-commital answers at first, still a step up from the solid No or
nonresponse commonly received, but we finally succeed on getting a Yes at the
end. character arc

## FAQ

1. Will Grandmasters actually be my friend using these techniques?
> No promises, but we all know you're just looking for a "one time stand" if
> you're messaging Grandmasters to begin with.

2. Is this rated?
> Uh, how do I even answer this?

[^1]: Disclaimer: Do not try this at home. This was performed on a closed course
  with trained professionals. Side effects include mild nausea, severe backlash,
  and a possible one way ticket to downvote purgatory. I'm not liable for any
  damages caused by/to you due to you following this advice.

[^2]: I know that making alt accounts is against CodeForces rules, but seeing as
  it was in the name of education, we sincerely hope Mike shall allow an
  exception without banishing me from the face of the Earth. Then again, there
  are accounts like [kaunta_oRZ](https://codeforces.com/profile/kaunta_orz)
  which simultaneously break the alt account rule and the "Do not use harsh,
  rude or **misleading** handle." guideline, so there remains hope yet.

[^3]: This seems like a good time to acknowledge that you won't be making
  "friends" in the classic sense of the word whether or not you succeed, but
  let's be honest with each other, you just wanted someone to explain editorials
  to begin with, so this fact seems negligible.
