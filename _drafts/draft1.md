## What is Battlehack?

Battlehack was a week long event where you were given a game and tasked with building the best bot you could make.



## Battlehack vs. CP

While Battlehack is technically competitive programming since you're competing against others with your programming, it's not the traditional short contests which you'd find on sites like AtCoder and Codeforces.

### Speed

Thanks to the longer timespan of the contest, speed isn't as important.



 but it's a completely different beast then your common short contests you'd find on AtCoder and Codeforces. With such a long contest duration, the speed that's crucial in short contests doesn't mean much. The hasty nature of short contests also means you code is extremely messy, doesn't follow any common programming no-nos like not using `goto`. 

## My Own Performance

[What did I learn from this experience]

## Outro

I'll be back with the regular Road to 2000 posts next week, but I really wanted to make a post on Battlehack to give you guys a unique perspective into a different kind of competitive programming. Hopefully I'll see some of you guys next year competing in Battlecode 2021, cya next year :p
