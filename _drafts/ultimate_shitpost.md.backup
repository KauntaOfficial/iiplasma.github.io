Want to get help on problems, but don't have any high rated friends? Don't want to pay for a CP mentor? I've got just the solution for you.


## Integrity
As with any sort of scientific experiment, it's important to ensure our results are as accurate as possible. To simulate the success of someone in a lower rating range, I've created an unrated alt account to show how these methods work even for the lowest rated people. For a random sample size of Grandmasters, we've selected 3 randomly generated from the pool of active competitors on Codeforces who I have 0 personal ties to as the testing group.

## Technique #1 - Death by Words (DW)
While GMs might intimidate you with their large rating, you can parry with an equally large vocabulary. Taking inspiration from peacocks, we'll artificially boost our "plumage" of knowledge to try and get the GM to respond. When writing any message to a GM, just throw it in this [text converter](https://honk.moe/tools/verysmart.html) to instantly boost your chances at getting a response. I will note that most people in the community see DbW as an extremely risky technique, but when it works, it works wonders.

### Meta Analysis

I've gone with a stock standard greeting followed by the classic, "long time no see, bro". This is essential to try and establish a line of connection between us instantly before he realizes what's being done. It's also key to note how I have multiple compilation errors to try and evoke sympathy from our unsuspecting Grandmaster. I've included another bonus tip in the submission on how to optimize your code, but for now we'll move onto his response.

Mr. Colin here must think he's quite clever now that he's outwitted us by asking where the submission is, but we aren't out of tricks yet. I've purposely left no response as an exercise for you to complete.


## Technique #2 - Write a Blog (WB)
Although this technique is lengthy and requires far greater amounts of work than the previous methods, it's also the most risk averse. You start a blog series on, I don't know, maybe some "Road to Reach xxxx" to lure GMs in like flies to honey. Once they leave a comment, you can quickly slide in their DMs with a "would you be willing to help" or something along the lines of what I show below. 

### Meta Analysis
I don't have any blog posts on this account, but luckily summit wasn't too observant. No promises you'll get as lucky as me. We're mixing it up from Technique 1 and starting off with a Sir instead of a Mr, nice bit of alliteration. For this example, I'm employed the famous "karangreat" Gambit. Because writing a blog is such a safe method to attracting Grandmasters, I wanted to spice it up and increase the risk levels by going for a gambit.

These GMs are proving to be tough nuts to crack as we got another nonresponse. The key thing to note is that Summit never explicitly says no, which signals that he would like to discuss the specifics such as monetary payment and payment options on another platform. I usually use Telegram along with Nord VPN for ultimate security, but I'll leave it at your discretion. Which means it's time to segue into our next technique.

## Technique #3 - Sow Discord (SD)
Start accussing them of using illicit drugs such as caffiene or heroin to try and blackmail them into complying. This is definitely high up on the spectrum for risk, but sometimes it's a risk you must take.


## Recap
Really the most important thing to take away from this blog is that persistence is key.
