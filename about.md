Hi! My name is Ivy Zhang, and this is where I'm currently documenting my
challenge to hit 2000 rating on
[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/Kaunta) in under a year. Besides just
acting as a psuedo-journal, I also write educational blogs on varing aspects of
competitive programming in general.
